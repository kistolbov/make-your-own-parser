# Make Your Own Parser

This project is a set of parsers that you can use both for yourself and for other needs. 
Here I decided to collect my parsers that I wrote before.

## Description

A parser is a software for collecting data and converting it into a structured format,
most often working with a text type of information.

Let's say you need to place a thousand product cards in your online store. This isn't a one-night stand.
You need to collect a lot of information, process, rewrite and fill out the cards.

To solve such problems, there are programs that scan the content of web pages on the Internet, search engine results,
and copy the same type (text or images) or universal (text and images) information. They allow you to recognize
huge amounts of continuously updated values.

The site parser performs the work in several stages:

- Search for the necessary information in the original form: getting access to the code of the Internet resource, 
downloading, downloading.
- Retrieves values from the web page code, while separating the required material from the page code.
- Generating a report according to the requirements that were set
(recording information directly in the database, text files).
